# Via Frontend
This test is a part of our hiring process at Via, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small Vue/React app coding challenge. It should take you no more than a [DEFINE TIME] to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed. Remember, we're looking for a <ins>Senior</ins> Frontend role. We'll pay a lot of attention to clean code, good architecture, design patterns, comments, etc. Imagine that this code will go into production.

## The assignment
We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:
- [ ] Create a new invoice
- [ ] Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
- [ ] Create at least one unit test for your code

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok). Try to use the same typography, colors, etc. 

#### Extra credit features
- [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
- [ ] Polish and UX
- [ ] Highly reusable components
- [ ] Responsive layout and design is a bonus. Please code that only if you have extra time.

## Requirements
You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:
- Vue / React 
- Use a state management library
- It’s okay to use create-react-app or similar tools.
- It’s okay to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, etc.
