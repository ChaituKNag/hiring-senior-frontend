# Via Frontend
This test is a part of our hiring process at Via, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small Vue/React app coding challenge. It should take you no more than a 4 hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed. You have 48 hours to finish the challenge, but let us know if you need more time. Remember, we're looking for a <ins>Senior</ins> Frontend role. We'll pay a lot of attention to clean code, good architecture, design patterns, comments, etc. Imagine that this code will go into production.

## The assignment
We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:
- [ ] Create a new invoice
- [ ] Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
- [ ] Create at least one unit test for your code

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok). Although this is not a design position, it is very important that you can translate design files (PSD, Figma, etc.) into code (HTML/CSS). For this assessment, there is no specific requirement for the design, feel free to do something on your own. If you need inspiration, use Airbnb or Stripe as a base.

#### Extra credit features
- [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
- [ ] Polish and UX
- [ ] Highly reusable components
- [ ] Responsive layout and design is a bonus. Please code that only if you have extra time.

## Requirements
You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:
- Vue / React 
- Use a state management library
- It’s okay to use create-react-app or similar tools.
- It’s okay to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, etc.

If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork so we can review. Do not forget to put instructions on how to run your code.
