# Via Frontend
This challenge is to evaluate your coding skills in Vue/React. This assignment should take you no more than 4 hours to complete, but any extra polish or features won’t go unnoticed. You have 48 hours to finish the challenge, but please let us know if you need more time. Clean code, good architecture, design patterns, comments, etc. Imagine that this code will go into production.

## The assignment
We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:
- [ ] Create a new invoice
- [ ] Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
- [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
- [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
- [ ] Create at least one test for your code

Your backend can be anything and does not have to work. You may use a mocked out interface or even static data in code. This is NOT a Design role, so there are no specific design requirements, feel free to own it. Although this is not a design position, it is very important that you can translate design files (PSD, Figma, etc.) into code (HTML/CSS). 

#### Extra credit features
- [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
- [ ] Polish and UX
- [ ] Highly reusable components
- [ ] Responsive layout and design is a bonus. Please code that only if you have extra time.

## Requirements
Use the following tools to accomplish this task:
- Vue / React 
- Use a state management library
- It’s okay to use create-react-app or similar tools.
- It’s okay to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, etc.

If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete the challenge, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork so we can review it. Do not forget to put instructions on how to run your code.
